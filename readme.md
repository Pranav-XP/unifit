1. **Facilities Management**  
   Facilities and facility types can be created, read, updated, and deleted (CRUD operations) by the administrators.
   
2. **Bookings**  
   Fully functional booking system allowing users to reserve available facilities. Admins can manage bookings and facility availability.
   
3. **Events Management**  
   Users and administrators can create, update, and manage events, which are integrated with the facilities and booking system.
   
4. **Notifications**  
   Real-time notifications using WebSockets for updates related to bookings, events, and facility management. Email notifications are sent via Gmail SMTP for booking confirmations and event reminders.

5. **Reporting**  
   Basic reporting functionality implemented to provide insights into facility usage, booking trends, and event attendance.

## Future Work

1. **Enhanced Reporting**  
   Expand the reporting features to include more detailed analytics and custom report generation.

2. **Event Management Enhancements**  
   Further improve event management by adding more customization options, better UI for event organization, and advanced notification systems for attendees.
